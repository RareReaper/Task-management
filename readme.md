# Task Management Web Application
#### Video Demo:  <URL HERE>
#### Description:
This is a web application designed using flask, and javascript, which allows a user to manage their activities and tasks in a orderly manner, and complete them within the defined time period.

This includes:
  1. Setting priority levels for each task.
  2. Defining a due date for each task.

The user can then complete this task, or delete it which is up to their discretion. The project uses SQLAlchemy as it's ORM(Object Relation Manager) which makes running SQL queries much simpler and less prone to SQL injection attacks, while being fully scalable to production level software.
This is also my final project for Harvard's CS50 online course which I completed recently. This is heavily inspired by the flask problem sets in the same.
